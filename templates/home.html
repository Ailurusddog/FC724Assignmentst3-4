            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>This website is designed to assess and collect data on students' progress at GIC. Navigate through the sections to learn more and participate.</p>
            <p>Kaplan and the University of Glasgow entered into a partnership to establish Glasgow International College (GIC) in 2007 with the first cohort of students joining the College in September 2007. GIC offers degree preparation courses in partnership with the University of Glasgow. Students have several course options at Glasgow International College, to prepare for an undergraduate or postgraduate degree at the University of Glasgow.</p>
            <p>GIC offers a Foundation Certificate and students who meet the criteria for progress to second year of particular undergraduate programmes at the University and Pre-Masters students who meet the criteria enter Masters programmes at the University.</p>
